# Design Pattern
Design patterns have been considered as some of the most reliable and useful approaches
to solving common software design problems. Patterns provide general and reusable
solutions to frequently occurring development issues, such as how to add functionality to
an object without changing its structure or how best to construct complex objects. </br>

<b>Design patterns can be categories into three parts:</b></br>

<li>Creational –> Used for creating objects</li>
<li>Structural –> Used for organizing groups of objects</li>
<li>Behavioral –> Used for communication between objects</li></br></br>

# FactoryPattern
The factory method pattern is a <b>creational</b> pattern that uses factory methods to deal with the problem
of creating objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created.
This is done by creating objects by calling a factory method either specified in an interface
and implemented by child classes, or implemented in a base class and optionally overridden by
derived classes rather than by calling a constructor.</br>
